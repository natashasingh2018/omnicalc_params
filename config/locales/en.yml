# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  hints:
    number_to_currency: Rails has a handy view helper method called [`number_to_currency()`](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/NumberHelper/number_to_currency) that makes this much easier!
    button_text: Make sure that the text on your `<button>` exactly matches the target, including capitalization.
    button_type: If you are having issues and you have an attribute `type="button"` on your `<button>` element, try removing it.
    label_for_input: Make sure that you have a `for=""` attribute on the `<label>` and that it matches the `id=""` attribute on the `<input>`; otherwise our test won't know which input goes with which label (and neither would screen readers, etc).
